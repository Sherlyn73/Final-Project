    <p>I decided to go into Cyber Security. When I decided this, I didn't know where or how to get started. My friend, Caitlin States, suggested that I contact Del, a former TA and Tech-Mom alumni. Thanks to Del, I know what I need to do; I know the path and the courses to take in order to prepare myself for this career. As my career progresses, I might move towards possibly being a Cyber Crime Investigator.</p>

    <h2>What is a Cybersecurity Specialist?</h2>
    
    <p>As stated on the CompTIA website, "Cybersecurity Professionals detect cyberthreats and implement changes to protect an organization. A security operations center (SOC) team likely has several tiers of cybersecurity professionals that are responsible for monitoring, directing, containing and remediating IT threats. Cybersecurity Professionals may be tasked with anything from installing, administering and troubleshooting security solutions to writing up security policies and training documents for colleagues. While other job roles are responsible for specific part of the overall system, Cybersecurity Professionals must be able to take a step back and see the big picture to keep it secure from threats."</p>
