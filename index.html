        <p>I decided to go into Cyber Security. When I decided this, I didn't know where or how to get started. My friend, Caitlin States, suggested that I contact Del, a former TA and Tech-Mom alumni. Thanks to Del, I know what I need to do; I know the path and the courses to take in order to prepare myself for this career. As my career progresses, I might move towards possibly being a Cyber Crime Investigator.</p></div>
