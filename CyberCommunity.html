            <p>There are many benefits to joining a community of cyber security professionals. There are resources for professionals and job seekers such as websites, newsletters, links for security blogs, news about upcoming events, cyberattacks and much more.

There is an extensive list of communities on the<a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-associations/#:~:text=ISSA%20is%20the%20community%20of,protecting%20critical%20information%20and%20infrastructure." target="_blank"> Cyber Crime Magazine</a> website; however, I'm sure there are many other communities not on their list.</p>
